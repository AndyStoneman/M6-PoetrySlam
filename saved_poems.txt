oh never this helping east baron snow of leicester swells

from a land's having lashed across it open

i saw you from that very flower there

nor mainly listen all the night long

now drops that floated on the precipitate

where they have left not one blizzard on a blizzard

your going and coming and you like it here

she's glad the fall are gone away
