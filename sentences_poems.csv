127,4,to stop it with a period of ink
128,4,"when something strange about it made me think,"
129,4,"this was no dust speck by my breathing blown,"
130,4,but unmistakably a living mite
131,4,"with inclinations it could call its own,"
132,4,"it paused as with suspicion of my pen,"
133,4,and then came racing wildly on again
134,4,to where my manuscript was not yet dry;

140,4,"to express how much it didn't want to die,"
141,4,"it ran with terror and with cunning crept,"

143,4,then in the middle of the open sheet
144,4,cower down in desperation to accept
145,4,"whatever i accorded it of fate,"

147,4,collectivistic regimenting love
148,4,"with which the modern world is being swept,"

150,4,since it was nothing i knew evil of
151,4,"i let it lie there till i hope it slept,"
152,4,

155,4,no one can know how glad i am to find
156,4,"on any sheet the least display of mind,"
157,5,"i had withdrawn in forest, and my song"
158,5,was swallowed up in leaves that blew alway;
159,5,and to the forest edge you came one day
160,5,"this was my dream and looked and pondered long,"
161,5,"but did not enter, though the wish was strong,"
162,5,"you shook your pensive head as who should say,"

165,5,
166,5,"not far, but near, i stood and saw it all"
167,5,behind low boughs the trees let down outside;
168,5,and the sweet pang it cost me not to call
169,5,"and tell you that i saw does still abide,"
170,5,"but 'tis not true that thus i dwelt aloof,"
171,5,"for the wood wakes, and you are here for proof,"
172,6,"when i go up through the mowing field,"
173,6,"the headless aftermath,"
174,6,"   smooth-laid like thatch with the heavy dew,"
175,6," half closes the garden path,"
176,6,
177,6,"   and when i come to the garden ground,"
178,6,the whir of sober birds
179,6, up from the tangle of withered weeds
180,6, is sadder than any words
181,6,

183,6," but a leaf that lingered brown,"
184,6,"   disturbed, i doubt not, by my thought,"
185,6," comes softly rattling down,"
186,6,
187,6, i end not far from my going forth
188,6,   by picking the faded blue
189,6,of the last remaining aster flower
190,6," to carry again to you,"
191,7,"the line-storm clouds fly tattered and swift,"
192,7," the road is forlorn all day,"
193,7,"where a myriad snowy quartz stones lift,"
194,7," and the hoof-prints vanish away,"
195,7,"the roadside flowers, too wet for the bee,"
196,7," expend their bloom in vain,"
197,7,"come over the hills and far with me,"
198,7," and be my love in the rain,"
199,7,
200,7,the birds have less to say for themselves
201,7, in the wood-world's torn despair
202,7,"than now these numberless years the elves,"
203,7," although they are no less there,"
204,7,all song of the woods is crushed like some
205,7," wild, earily shattered rose,"
206,7,"come, be my love in the wet woods, come,"
207,7," where the boughs rain when it blows,"
208,7,
209,7,there is the gale to urge behind
210,7," and bruit our singing down,"
211,7,and the shallow waters aflutter with wind
212,7," from which to gather your gown,"
213,7,"what matter if we go clear to the west,"
214,7, and come not through dry-shod?
215,7,for wilding brooch shall wet your breast
216,7," the rain-fresh goldenrod,"
217,7,
218,7,"oh, never this whelming east wind swells"
219,7, but it seems like the sea's return
220,7,to the ancient lands where it left the shells
221,7, before the age of the fern;
222,7,and it seems like the time when after doubt
223,7," our love came back amain,"
224,7,"oh, come forth into the storm and rout"
225,7," and be my love in the rain,"
226,8,"i have wished a bird would fly away,"
227,8,and not sing by my house all day;
228,8,
229,8,have clapped my hands at him from the door
230,8,"when it seemed as if i could bear no more,"
231,8,
232,8,"the fault must partly have been in me,"
233,8,"the bird was not to blame for his key,"
234,8,
235,8,and of course there must be something wrong
236,8,"in wanting to silence any song,"
237,9,there's a patch of old snow in a corner
238,9,that i should have guessed
239,9,was a blow-away paper the rain
240,9,"had brought to rest,"
241,9,
242,9,it is speckled with grime as if
243,9,"small print overspread it,"
244,9,the news of a day i've forgotten --
245,9,"if i ever read it,"
246,10,"oh, give us pleasure in the flowers today;"
247,10,and give us not to think so far away
248,10,as the uncertain harvest; keep us here
249,10,"all simply in the springing of the year,"
250,10,
251,10,"oh, give us pleasure in the orchard white,"
252,10,"like nothing else by day, like ghosts by night;"
253,10,"and make us happy in the happy bees,"
254,10,"the swarm dilating round the perfect trees,"
255,10,
256,10,and make us happy in the darting bird
257,10,"that suddenly above the bees is heard,"
258,10,"the meteor that thrusts in with needle bill,"
259,10,"and off a blossom in mid air stands still,"
260,10,
261,10,"for this is love and nothing else is love,"
262,10,to which it is reserved for god above
263,10,"to sanctify to what far ends he will,"
264,10,"but which it only needs that we fulfill,"
265,11,"a voice said, look me in the stars"
266,11,"and tell me truly, men of earth,"
267,11,if all the soul-and-body scars
268,11,"were not too much to pay for birth,"
269,12,i didn't make you know how glad i was
270,12,"to have you come and camp here on our land,"
271,12,i promised myself to get down some day
272,12,"and see the way you lived, but i don't know!"
273,12,with a houseful of hungry men to feed
274,12,"i guess you'd find,, it seems to me"
275,12,i can't express my feelings any more
276,12,than i can raise my voice or want to lift
277,12,"my hand oh, i can lift it when i have to,"
278,12,"did ever you feel so? i hope you never,"
279,12,it's got so i don't even know for sure
280,12,"whether i am glad, sorry, or anything,"
281,12,there's nothing but a voice-like left inside
282,12,"that seems to tell me how i ought to feel,"
283,12,"and would feel if i wasn't all gone wrong,"
284,12,"you take the lake, i look and look at it,"
285,12,"i see it's a fair, pretty sheet of water,"
286,12,i stand and make myself repeat out loud
287,12,"the advantages it has, so long and narrow,"
288,12,like a deep piece of some old running river
289,12,"cut short off at both ends, it lies five miles"
290,12,straight away through the mountain notch
291,12,"from the sink window where i wash the plates,"
292,12,"and all our storms come up toward the house,"
293,12,"drawing the slow waves whiter and whiter and whiter,"
294,12,it took my mind off doughnuts and soda biscuit
295,12,to step outdoors and take the water dazzle
296,12,"a sunny morning, or take the rising wind"
297,12,"about my face and body and through my wrapper,"
298,12,"when a storm threatened from the dragon's den,"
299,12,"and a cold chill shivered across the lake,"
300,12,"i see it's a fair, pretty sheet of water,"
301,12,our willoughby! how did you hear of it?
302,12,"i expect, though, everyone's heard of it,"
303,12,in a book about ferns? listen to that!
304,12,you let things more like feathers regulate
305,12,"your going and coming, and you like it here?"
306,12,"i can see how you might, but i don't know!"
307,12,"it would be different if more people came,"
308,12,"for then there would be business, as it is,"
309,12,"the cottages len built, sometimes we rent them,"
310,12,"sometimes we don't, we've a good piece of shore"
311,12,"that ought to be worth something, and may yet,"
312,12,"but i don't count on it as much as len,"
313,12,"he looks on the bright side of everything,"
314,12,"including me, he thinks i'll be all right"
315,12,"with doctoring, but it's not medicine--"
316,12,lowe is the only doctor's dared to say so--
317,12,"it's rest i want--there, i have said it out--"
318,12,from cooking meals for hungry hired men
319,12,and washing dishes after them--from doing
320,12,"things over and over that just won't stay done,"
321,12,by good rights i ought not to have so much
322,12,"put on me, but there seems no other way,"
323,12,"len says one steady pull more ought to do it,"
324,12,"he says the best way out is always through,"
325,12,"and i agree to that, or in so far"
326,12,as that i can see no way out but through--
327,12,"leastways for me--and then they'll be convinced,"
328,12,"it's not that len don't want the best for me,"
329,12,it was his plan our moving over in
330,12,beside the lake from where that day i showed you
331,12,"we used to live--ten miles from anywhere,"
332,12,"we didn't change without some sacrifice,"
333,12,"but len went at it to make up the loss,"
334,12,"his work's a man's, of course, from sun to sun,"
335,12,but he works when he works as hard as i do--
336,12,"though there's small profit in comparisons,"
337,12,"women and men will make them all the same,"
338,12,"but work ain't all, len undertakes too much,"
339,12,"he's into everything in town, this year"
340,12,"it's highways, and he's got too many men"
341,12,"around him to look after that make waste,"
342,12,"they take advantage of him shamefully,"
343,12,"and proud, too, of themselves for doing so,"
344,12,"we have four here to board, great good-for-nothings,"
345,12,sprawling about the kitchen with their talk
346,12,"while i fry their bacon, much they care!"
347,12,no more put out in what they do or say
348,12,"than if i wasn't in the room at all,"
349,12,"coming and going all the time, they are,"
350,12,"i don't learn what their names are, let alone"
351,12,"their characters, or whether they are safe"
352,12,"to have inside the house with doors unlocked,"
353,12,"i'm not afraid of them, though, if they're not"
354,12,"afraid of me, there's two can play at that,"
355,12,"i have my fancies, it runs in the family,"
356,12,"my father's brother wasn't right, they kept him"
357,12,"locked up for years back there at the old farm,"
358,12,"i've been away once--yes, i've been away,"
359,12,"the state asylum, i was prejudiced;"
360,12,i wouldn't have sent anyone of mine there;
361,12,you know the old idea--the only asylum
362,12,"was the poorhouse, and those who could afford,"
363,12,"rather than send their folks to such a place,"
364,12,"kept them at home; and it does seem more human,"
365,12,"but it's not so, the place is the asylum,"
366,12,"there they have every means proper to do with,"
367,12,and you aren't darkening other people's lives--
368,12,"worse than no good to them, and they no good"
369,12,to you in your condition; you can't know
370,12,"affection or the want of it in that state,"
371,12,"i've heard too much of the old-fashioned way,"
372,12,"my father's brother, he went mad quite young,"
373,12,"some thought he had been bitten by a dog,"
374,12,because his violence took on the form
375,12,of carrying his pillow in his teeth;
376,12,"but it's more likely he was crossed in love,"
377,12,"or so the story goes, it was some girl,"
378,12,"anyway all he talked about was love,"
379,12,they soon saw he would do someone a mischief
380,12,"if he wa'n't kept strict watch of, and it ended"
381,12,"in father's building him a sort of cage,"
382,12,"or room within a room, of hickory poles,"
383,12,"like stanchions in the barn, from floor to ceiling,--"
384,12,"a narrow passage all the way around,"
385,12,anything they put in for furniture
386,12,"he'd tear to pieces, even a bed to lie on,"
387,12,"so they made the place comfortable with straw,"
388,12,"like a beast's stall, to ease their consciences,"
389,12,"of course they had to feed him without dishes,"
390,12,"they tried to keep him clothed, but he paraded"
391,12,"with his clothes on his arm--all of his clothes,"
392,12,"cruel--it sounds, i 'spose they did the best"
393,12,"they knew, and just when he was at the height,"
394,12,"father and mother married, and mother came,"
395,12,"a bride, to help take care of such a creature,"
396,12,"and accommodate her young life to his,"
397,12,"that was what marrying father meant to her,"
398,12,she had to lie and hear love things made dreadful
399,12,"by his shouts in the night, he'd shout and shout"
400,12,"until the strength was shouted out of him,"
401,12,"and his voice died down slowly from exhaustion,"
402,12,"he'd pull his bars apart like bow and bow-string,"
403,12,and let them go and make them twang until
404,12,"his hands had worn them smooth as any ox-bow,"
405,12,and then he'd crow as if he thought that child's play--
406,12,"the only fun he had, i've heard them say, though,"
407,12,"they found a way to put a stop to it,"
408,12,he was before my time--i never saw him;
409,12,but the pen stayed exactly as it was
410,12,"there in the upper chamber in the ell,"
411,12,"a sort of catch-all full of attic clutter,"
412,12,"i often think of the smooth hickory bars,"
413,12,"it got so i would say--you know, half fooling--"
414,12,"""it's time i took my turn upstairs in jail""--"
415,12,"just as you will till it becomes a habit,"
416,12,"no wonder i was glad to get away,"
417,12,"mind you, i waited till len said the word,"
418,12,"i didn't want the blame if things went wrong,"
419,12,"i was glad though, no end, when we moved out,"
420,12,"and i looked to be happy, and i was,"
421,12,"as i said, for a while--but i don't know!"
422,12,"somehow the change wore out like a prescription,"
423,12,and there's more to it than just window-views
424,12,"and living by a lake, i'm past such help--"
425,12,"unless len took the notion, which he won't,"
426,12,"and i won't ask him--it's not sure enough,"
427,12,"i 'spose i've got to go the road i'm going,"
428,12,"other folks have to, and why shouldn't i?"
429,12,"i almost think if i could do like you,"
430,12,drop everything and live out on the ground--
431,12,"but it might be, come night, i shouldn't like it,"
432,12,"or a long rain, i should soon get enough,"
433,12,"and be glad of a good roof overhead,"
434,12,"i've lain awake thinking of you, i'll warrant,"
435,12,"more than you have yourself, some of these nights,"
436,12,the wonder was the tents weren't snatched away
437,12,"from over you as you lay in your beds,"
438,12,"i haven't courage for a risk like that,"
439,12,"bless you, of course, you're keeping me from work,"
440,12,"but the thing of it is, i need to be kept,"
441,12,there's work enough to do--there's always that;
442,12,"but behind's behind, the worst that you can do"
443,12,"is set me back a little more behind,"
444,12,"i sha'n't catch up in this world, anyway,"
445,12,"i'd rather you'd not go unless you must,"
446,13,"he is that fallen lance that lies as hurled,"
447,13,"that lies unlifted now, come dew, come rust,"
448,13,"but still lies pointed as it plowed the dust,"
449,13,"if we who sight along it round the world,"
450,13,"see nothing worthy to have been its mark,"
451,13,"it is because like men we look too near,"
452,13,"forgetting that as fitted to the sphere,"
453,13,"our missiles always make too short an arc,"
454,13,"they fall, they rip the grass, they intersect"
455,13,"the curve of earth, and striking, break their own;"
456,13,"they make us cringe for metal-point on stone,"
457,13,"but this we know, the obstacle that checked"
458,13,"and tripped the body, shot the spirit on"
459,13,"further than target ever showed or shone,"
460,14,when a friend calls to me from the road
461,14,"and slows his horse to a meaning walk,"
462,14,i don't stand still and look around
463,14,"on all the hills i haven't hoed,"
464,14,"and shout from where i am, what is it?"
465,14,"no, not as there is a time to talk,"
466,14,"i thrust my hoe in the mellow ground,"
467,14,"blade-end up and five feet tall,"
468,14,"and plod, i go up to the stone wall"
469,14,"for a friendly visit,"
470,15,"i have been one acquainted with the night,"
471,15,"i have walked out in rain -- and back in rain,"
472,15,"i have outwalked the furthest city light,"
473,15,
474,15,"i have looked down the saddest city lane,"
475,15,i have passed by the watchman on his beat
476,15,"and dropped my eyes, unwilling to explain,"
477,15,
478,15,i have stood still and stopped the sound of feet
479,15,when far away an interrupted cry
480,15,"came over houses from another street,"
481,15,
482,15,but not to call me back or say good-bye;
483,15,"and further still at an unearthly height,"
484,15,a luminary clock against the sky
485,15,
486,15,"proclaimed the time was neither wrong nor right,"
487,15,"i have been one acquainted with the night,"
488,16,my long two-pointed ladder's sticking through a tree
489,16,"toward heaven still,"
490,16,and there's a barrel that i didn't fill
491,16,"beside it, and there may be two or three"
492,16,"apples i didn't pick upon some bough,"
493,16,"but i am done with apple-picking now,"
494,16,"essence of winter sleep is on the night,"
495,16,"the scent of apples, i am drowsing off,"
496,16,i cannot rub the strangeness from my sight
497,16,i got from looking through a pane of glass
498,16,i skimmed this morning from the drinking trough
499,16,"and held against the world of hoary grass,"
500,16,"it melted, and i let it fall and break,"
501,16,but i was well
502,16,"upon my way to sleep before it fell,"
503,16,and i could tell
504,16,"what form my dreaming was about to take,"
505,16,"magnified apples appear and disappear,"
506,16,"stem end and blossom end,"
507,16,"and every fleck of russet showing clear,"
508,16,"my instep arch not only keeps the ache,"
509,16,"it keeps the pressure of a ladder-round,"
510,16,"i feel the ladder sway as the boughs bend,"
511,16,and i keep hearing from the cellar bin
512,16,the rumbling sound
513,16,"of load on load of apples coming in,"
514,16,for i have had too much
515,16,"of apple-picking, i am overtired"
516,16,"of the great harvest i myself desired,"
517,16,"there were ten thousand thousand fruit to touch,"
518,16,"cherish in hand, lift down, and not let fall,"
519,16,for all
520,16,"that struck the earth,"
521,16,"no matter if not bruised or spiked with stubble,"
522,16,went surely to the cider-apple heap
523,16,"as of no worth,"
524,16,one can see what will trouble
525,16,"this sleep of mine, whatever sleep it is,"
526,16,"were he not gone,"
527,16,the woodchuck could say whether it's like his
528,16,"long sleep, as i describe its coming on,"
529,16,"or just some human sleep,"
530,17,all out of doors looked darkly in at him
531,17,"through the thin frost, almost in separate stars,"
532,17,"that gathers on the pane in empty rooms,"
533,17,what kept his eyes from giving back the gaze
534,17,"was the lamp tilted near them in his hand,"
535,17,what kept him from remembering what it was
536,17,"that brought him to that creaking room was age,"
537,17,"he stood with barrels round him -- at a loss,"
538,17,and having scared the cellar under him
539,17,"in clomping there, he scared it once again"
540,17,"in clomping off; -- and scared the outer night,"
541,17,"which has its sounds, familiar, like the roar"
542,17,"of trees and crack of branches, common things,"
543,17,"but nothing so like beating on a box,"
544,17,a light he was to no one but himself
545,17,"where now he sat, concerned with he knew what,"
546,17,"a quiet light, and then not even that,"
547,17,"he consigned to the moon, such as she was,"
548,17,"so late-arising, to the broken moon"
549,17,as better than the sun in any case
550,17,"for such a charge, his snow upon the roof,"
551,17,his icicles along the wall to keep;
552,17,"and slept, the log that shifted with a jolt"
553,17,"once in the stove, disturbed him and he shifted,"
554,17,"and eased his heavy breathing, but still slept,"
555,17,"one aged man -- one man -- can't keep a house,"
556,17,"a farm, a countryside, or if he can,"
557,17,"it's thus he does it of a winter night,"
558,18,"a house that lacks, seemingly, mistress and master,"
559,18,"with doors that none but the wind ever closes,"
560,18,its floor all littered with glass and with plaster;
561,18,"it stands in a garden of old-fashioned roses,"
562,18,
563,18,i pass by that way in the gloaming with mary;
564,18,"'i wonder,' i say, 'who the owner of those is,'"
565,18,"'oh, no one you know,' she answers me airy,"
566,18,"'but one we must ask if we want any roses,'"
567,18,
568,18,so we must join hands in the dew coming coldly
569,18,"there in the hush of the wood that reposes,"
570,18,"and turn and go up to the open door boldly,"
571,18,"and knock to the echoes as beggars for roses,"
572,18,
573,18,"'pray, are you within there, mistress who-were-you?'"
574,18,"'tis mary that speaks and our errand discloses,"
575,18,"'pray, are you within there? bestir you, bestir you!"
576,18,"'tis summer again; there's two come for roses,"
577,18,
578,18,"'a word with you, that of the singer recalling--"
579,18,"old herrick, a saying that every maid knows is"
580,18,"a flower unplucked is but left to the falling,"
581,18,"and nothing is gained by not gathering roses,'"
582,18,
583,18,we do not loosen our hands' intertwining
584,18,"not caring so very much what she supposes,"
585,18,there when she comes on us mistily shining
586,18,"and grants us by silence the boon of her roses,"
587,19,where had i heard this wind before
588,19,change like this to a deeper roar?
589,19,"what would it take my standing there for,"
590,19,"holding open a restive door,"
591,19,looking down hill to a frothy shore?
592,19,"summer was past and the day was past,"
593,19,"sombre clouds in the west were massed,"
594,19,"out on the porch's sagging floor,"
595,19,"leaves got up in a coil and hissed,"
596,19,"blindly striking at my knee and missed,"
597,19,something sinister in the tone
598,19,"told me my secret my be known,"
599,19,word i was in the house alone
600,19,"somehow must have gotten abroad,"
601,19,"word i was in my life alone,"
602,19,"word i had no one left but god,"
603,20,when i see birches bend to left and right
604,20,"across the lines of straighter darker trees,"
605,20,"i like to think some boy's been swinging them,"
606,20,"but swinging doesn't bend them down to stay,"
607,20,"ice-storms do that, often you must have seen them"
608,20,loaded with ice a sunny winter morning
609,20,"after a rain, they click upon themselves"
610,20,"as the breeze rises, and turn many-colored"
611,20,"as the stir cracks and crazes their enamel,"
612,20,soon the sun's warmth makes them shed crystal shells
613,20,shattering and avalanching on the snow-crust--
614,20,such heaps of broken glass to sweep away
615,20,"you'd think the inner dome of heaven had fallen,"
616,20,"they are dragged to the withered bracken by the load,"
617,20,and they seem not to break; though once they are bowed
618,20,"so low for long, they never right themselves,"
619,20,you may see their trunks arching in the woods
620,20,"years afterwards, trailing their leaves on the ground"
621,20,like girls on hands and knees that throw their hair
622,20,"before them over their heads to dry in the sun,"
623,20,but i was going to say when truth broke in
624,20,with all her matter-of-fact about the ice-storm
625,20,now am i free to be poetical?
626,20,i should prefer to have some boy bend them
627,20,as he went out and in to fetch the cows--
628,20,"some boy too far from town to learn baseball,"
629,20,"whose only play was what he found himself,"
630,20,"summer or winter, and could play alone,"
631,20,one by one he subdued his father's trees
632,20,by riding them down over and over again
633,20,"until he took the stiffness out of them,"
634,20,"and not one but hung limp, not one was left"
635,20,"for him to conquer, he learned all there was"
636,20,to learn about not launching out too soon
637,20,and so not carrying the tree away
638,20,"clear to the ground, he always kept his poise"
639,20,"to the top branches, climbing carefully"
640,20,with the same pains you use to fill a cup
641,20,"up to the brim, and even above the brim,"
642,20,"then he flung outward, feet first, with a swish,"
643,20,"kicking his way down through the air to the ground,"
644,20,"so was i once myself a swinger of birches,"
645,20,"and so i dream of going back to be,"
646,20,"it's when i'm weary of considerations,"
647,20,and life is too much like a pathless wood
648,20,where your face burns and tickles with the cobwebs
649,20,"broken across it, and one eye is weeping"
650,20,"from a twig's having lashed across it open,"
651,20,i'd like to get away from earth awhile
652,20,"and then come back to it and begin over,"
653,20,may no fate willfully misunderstand me
654,20,and half grant what i wish and snatch me away
655,20,"not to return, earth's the right place for love,"
656,20,"i don't know where it's likely to go better,"
657,20,"i'd like to go by climbing a birch tree,"
658,20,and climb black branches up a snow-white trunk
659,20,"toward heaven, till the tree could bear no more,"
660,20,"but dipped its top and set me down again,"
661,20,"that would be good both going and coming back,"
662,20,"one could do worse than be a swinger of birches,"
663,21,love has earth to which she clings
664,21,with hills and circling arms about--
665,21,"wall within wall to shut fear out,"
666,21,"but thought has need of no such things,"
667,21,"for thought has a pair of dauntless wings,"
668,21,
669,21,"on snow and sand and turn, i see"
670,21,where love has left a printed trace
671,21,"with straining in the world's embrace,"
672,21,and such is love and glad to be
673,21,"but thought has shaken his ankles free,"
674,21,
675,21,thought cleaves the interstellar gloom
676,21,"and sits in sirius' disc all night,"
677,21,till day makes him retrace his flight
678,21,"with smell of burning on every plume,"
679,21,"back past the sun to an earthly room,"
680,21,
681,21,"his gains in heaven are what they are,"
682,21,yet some say love by being thrall
683,21,and simply staying possesses all
684,21,in several beauty that thought fares far
685,21,"to find fused in another star,"
686,22,"but outer space,"
687,22,"at least this far,"
688,22,for all the fuss
689,22,of the populace
690,22,stays more popular
691,22,than populous
692,23,"as i came to the edge of the woods,"
693,23,thrush music -- hark!
694,23,"now if it was dusk outside,"
695,23,"inside it was dark,"
696,23,
697,23,too dark in the woods for a bird
698,23,by sleight of wing
699,23,"to better its perch for the night,"
700,23,"though it still could sing,"
701,23,
702,23,the last of the light of the sun
703,23,that had died in the west
704,23,still lived for one song more
705,23,"in a thrush's breast,"
706,23,
707,23,far in the pillared dark
708,23,thrush music went --
709,23,almost like a call to come in
710,23,"to the dark and lament,"
711,23,
712,23,"but no, i was out for stars;"
713,23,"i would not come in,"
714,23,i meant not even if asked;
715,23,"and i hadn't been,"
716,24,an ant on the tablecloth
717,24,ran into a dormant moth
718,24,"of many times his size,"
719,24,"he showed not the least surprise,"
720,24,"his business wasn't with such,"
721,24,"he gave it scarcely a touch,"
722,24,"and was off on his duty run,"
723,24,yet if he encountered one
724,24,of the hive's enquiry squad
725,24,whose work is to find out god
726,24,"and the nature of time and space,"
727,24,"he would put him onto the case,"
728,24,ants are a curious race;
729,24,one crossing with hurried tread
730,24,the body of one of their dead
731,24,isn't given a moment's arrest-
732,24,"seems not even impressed,"
733,24,but he no doubt reports to any
734,24,"with whom he crosses antennae,"
735,24,and they no doubt report
736,24,"to the higher-up at court,"
737,24,"then word goes forth in formic,"
738,24,"""death's come to jerry mccormic,"
739,24,"our selfless forager jerry,"
740,24,will the special janizary
741,24,whose office it is to bury
742,24,the dead of the commissary
743,24,"go bring him home to his people,"
744,24,"lay him in state on a sepal,"
745,24,"wrap him for shroud in a petal,"
746,24,"embalm him with ichor of nettle,"
747,24,"this is the word of your queen,"""
748,24,and presently on the scene
749,24,appears a solemn mortician;
750,24,"and taking formal position,"
751,24,"with feelers calmly atwiddle,"
752,24,"seizes the dead by the middle,"
753,24,"and heaving him high in air,"
754,24,"carries him out of there,"
755,24,"no one stands round to stare,"
756,24,it is nobody else's affair
757,24,it couldn't be called ungentle
758,24,but how thoroughly departmental
759,25,"snow falling and night falling fast, oh, fast"
760,25,"in a field i looked into going past,"
761,25,"and the ground almost covered smooth in snow,"
762,25,"but a few weeds and stubble showing last,"
763,25,
764,25,"the woods around it have it - it is theirs,"
765,25,"all animals are smothered in their lairs,"
766,25,i am too absent-spirited to count;
767,25,"the loneliness includes me unawares,"
768,25,
769,25,"and lonely as it is, that loneliness"
770,25,will be more lonely ere it will be less -
771,25,a blanker whiteness of benighted snow
772,25,"with no expression, nothing to express,"
773,25,
774,25,they cannot scare me with their empty spaces
775,25,"between stars - on stars where no human race is,"
776,25,i have it in me so much nearer home
777,25,"to scare myself with my own desert places,"
778,26,"i found a dimpled spider, fat and white,"
779,26,"on a white heal-all, holding up a moth"
780,26,like a white piece of rigid satin cloth --
781,26,assorted characters of death and blight
782,26,"mixed ready to begin the morning right,"
783,26,like the ingredients of a witches' broth --
784,26,"a snow-drop spider, a flower like a froth,"
785,26,"and dead wings carried like a paper kite,"
786,26,
787,26,"what had that flower to do with being white,"
788,26,the wayside blue and innocent heal-all?
789,26,"what brought the kindred spider to that height,"
790,26,then steered the white moth thither in the night?
791,26,what but design of darkness to appall?--
792,26,"if design govern in a thing so small,"
793,27,the heart can think of no devotion
794,27,greater than being shore to ocean -
795,27,"holding the curve of one position,"
796,27,"counting an endless repetition,"
797,28,the way a crow
798,28,shook down on me
799,28,the dust of snow
800,28,from a hemlock tree
801,28,has given my heart
802,28,a change of mood
803,28,and saved some part
804,28,"of a day i had rued,"
805,29,from where i lingered in a lull in march
806,29,"outside the sugar-house one night for choice,"
807,29,i called the fireman with a careful voice
808,29,"and bade him leave the pan and stoke the arch,"
809,29,"'o fireman, give the fire another stoke,"
810,29,"and send more sparks up chimney with the smoke,'"
811,29,"i thought a few might tangle, as they did,"
812,29,"among bare maple boughs, and in the rare"
813,29,"hill atmosphere not cease to glow,"
814,29,"and so be added to the moon up there,"
815,29,"the moon, though slight, was moon enough to show"
816,29,"on every tree a bucket with a lid,"
817,29,"and on black ground a bear-skin rug of snow,"
818,29,"the sparks made no attempt to be the moon,"
819,29,they were content to figure in the trees
820,29,"as leo, orion, and the pleiades,"
821,29,"and that was what the boughs were full of soon,"
822,30,"some say the world will end in fire,"
823,30,"  some say in ice,"
824,30,  from what i've tasted of desire
825,30,"  i hold with those who favor fire,"
826,30,"  but if it had to perish twice,"
827,30,  i think i know enough of hate
828,30,  to know that for destruction ice
829,30,  is also great
830,30,"  and would suffice,"
831,31,"here come real stars to fill the upper skies,"
832,31,"and here on earth come emulating flies,"
833,31,"that though they never equal stars in size,"
834,31,and they were never really stars at heart
835,31,"achieve at times a very star-like start,"
836,31,"only, of course, they can't sustain the part,"
837,32,"i left you in the morning,"
838,32,"and in the morning glow,"
839,32,you walked a way beside me
840,32,"to make me sad to go,"
841,32,"do you know me in the gloaming,"
842,32,gaunt and dusty gray with roaming?
843,32,"are you dumb because you know me not,"
844,32,or dumb because you know?
845,32,
846,32,all for me  and not a question
847,32,for the faded flowers gay
848,32,that could take me from beside you
849,32,for the ages of a day?
850,32,"they are yours, and be the measure"
851,32,"of their worth for you to treasure,"
852,32,the measure of the little while
853,32,"that i've been long away,"
854,33,others taught me with having knelt at well-curbs
855,33,"  always wrong to the light, so never seeing"
856,33,  deeper down in the well than where the water
857,33,  gives me back in a shining surface picture
858,33,  me myself in the summer heaven godlike
859,33,"  looking out of a wreath of fern and cloud puffs,"
860,33,"  once, when trying with chin against a well-curb,"
861,33,"  i discerned, as i thought, beyond the picture,"
862,33,"  through the picture, a something white, uncertain,"
863,33," something more of the depths--and then i lost it,"
864,33," water came to rebuke the too clear water,"
865,33," one drop fell from a fern, and lo, a ripple"
866,33," shook whatever it was lay there at bottom,"
867,33," blurred it, blotted it out, what was that whiteness?"
868,33,
869,33," truth? a pebble of quartz? for once, then, something,"
870,34,why make so much of fragmentary blue
871,34,"in here and there a bird, or butterfly,"
872,34,"or flower, or wearing-stone, or open eye,"
873,34,when heaven presents in sheets the solid hue?
874,34,
875,34,"since earth is earth, perhaps, not heaven as yet--"
876,34,though some savants make earth include the sky;
877,34,"and blue so far above us comes so high,"
878,34,"it only gives our wish for blue a whet,"
879,35,spades take up leaves
880,35,"no better than spoons,"
881,35,and bags full of leaves
882,35,"are light as balloons,"
883,35,
884,35,i make a great noise
885,35,of rustling all day
886,35,like rabbit and deer
887,35,"running away,"
888,35,
889,35,but the mountains i raise
890,35,"elude my embrace,"
891,35,flowing over my arms
892,35,"and into my face,"
893,35,
894,35,i may load and unload
895,35,again and again
896,35,"till i fill the whole shed,"
897,35,and what have i then?
898,35,
899,35,"next to nothing for weight,"
900,35,and since they grew duller
901,35,"from contact with earth,"
902,35,"next to nothing for color,"
903,35,
904,35,"next to nothing for use,"
905,35,"but a crop is a crop,"
906,35,and who's to say where
907,35,the harvest shall stop?
908,36,i dwell in a lonely house i know
909,36,"that vanished many a summer ago,"
910,36,"and left no trace but the cellar walls,"
911,36,"and a cellar in which the daylight falls,"
912,36,"and the purple-stemmed wild raspberries grow,"
913,36,
914,36,o'er ruined fences the grape-vines shield
915,36,the woods come back to the mowing field;
916,36,the orchard tree has grown one copse
917,36,of new wood and old where the woodpecker chops;
918,36,"the footpath down to the well is healed,"
919,36,
920,36,i dwell with a strangely aching heart
921,36,in that vanished abode there far apart
922,36,on that disused and forgotten road
923,36,"that has no dust-bath now for the toad,"
924,36,night comes; the black bats tumble and dart;
925,36,
926,36,the whippoorwill is coming to shout
927,36,"and hush and cluck and flutter about,"
928,36,i hear him begin far enough away
929,36,full many a time to say his say
930,36,"before he arrives to say it out,"
931,36,
932,36,"it is under the small, dim, summer star,"
933,36,i know not who these mute folk are
934,36,who share the unlit place with me--
935,36,those stones out under the low-limbed tree
936,36,"doubtless bear names that the mosses mar,"
937,36,
938,36,"they are tireless folk, but slow and sad,"
939,36,"though two, close-keeping, are lass and lad,--"
940,36,"with none among them that ever sings,"
941,36,"and yet, in view of how many things,"
942,36,"as sweet companions as might be had,"
943,37,"the well was dry beside the door,"
944,37,and so we went with pail and can
945,37,across the fields behind the house
946,37,to seek the brook if still it ran;
947,37,"not loth to have excuse to go,"
948,37,because the autumn eve was fair
949,37,"though chill, because the fields were ours,"
950,37,"and by the brook our woods were there,"
951,37,
952,37,we ran as if to meet the moon
953,37,"that slowly dawned behind the trees,"
954,37,"the barren boughs without the leaves,"
955,37,"without the birds, without the breeze,"
956,37,
957,37,"but once within the wood, we paused"
958,37,"like gnomes that hid us from the moon,"
959,37,ready to run to hiding new
960,37,"with laughter when she found us soon,"
961,37,
962,37,each laid on other a staying hand
963,37,"to listen ere we dared to look,"
964,37,and in the hush we joined to make
965,37,"we heard, we knew we heard the brook,"
966,37,
967,37,"a note as from a single place,"
968,37,a slender tinkling fall that made
969,37,now drops that floated on the pool
970,37,"like pearls, and now a silver blade,"
971,38,this saying good-bye on the edge of the dark
972,38,  and cold to an orchard so young in the bark
973,38,  reminds me of all that can happen to harm
974,38,  an orchard away at the end of the farm
975,38,"  all winter, cut off by a hill from the house,"
976,38,"  i don't want it girdled by rabbit and mouse,"
977,38,  i don't want it dreamily nibbled for browse
978,38,"  by deer, and i don't want it budded by grouse,"
979,38,  if certain it wouldn't be idle to call
980,38," i'd summon grouse, rabbit, and deer to the wall"
981,38," and warn them away with a stick for a gun,"
982,38," i don't want it stirred by the heat of the sun,"
983,38," we made it secure against being, i hope,"
984,38," by setting it out on a northerly slope,"
985,38, no orchard's the worse for the wintriest storm;
986,38," but one thing about it, it mustn't get warm,"
987,38," ""how often already you've had to be told,"
988,38," keep cold, young orchard, good-bye and keep cold,"
989,38," dread fifty above more than fifty below,"""
990,38," i have to be gone for a season or so,"
991,38," my business awhile is with different trees,"
992,38," less carefully nourished, less fruitful than these,"
993,38, and such as is done to their wood with an axe--
994,38," maples and birches and tamaracks,"
995,38, i wish i could promise to lie in the night
996,38, and think of an orchard's arboreal plight
997,38, when slowly and nobody comes with a light
998,38," its heart sinks lower under the sod,"
999,38," but something has to be left to god,"
1000,39,"was there even a cause too lost,"
1001,39,"ever a cause that was lost too long,"
1002,39,or that showed with the lapse of time to vain
1003,39,for the generous tears of youth and song?
1004,40,he saw her from the bottom of the stairs
1005,40,"before she saw him, she was starting down,"
1006,40,"looking back over her shoulder at some fear,"
1007,40,she took a doubtful step and then undid it
1008,40,"to raise herself and look again, he spoke"
1009,40,"advancing toward her, ""what is it you see"
1010,40,"from up there always? -- for i want to know,"""
1011,40,"she turned and sank upon her skirts at that,"
1012,40,"and her face changed from terrified to dull,"
1013,40,"he said to gain time, ""what is it you see?"""
1014,40,"mounting until she cowered under him,"
1015,40,"""i will find out now -- you must tell me, dear,"""
1016,40,"she, in her place, refused him any help,"
1017,40,"with the least stiffening of her neck and silence,"
1018,40,"she let him look, sure that he wouldn't see,"
1019,40,"blind creature; and a while he didn't see,"
1020,40,"but at last he murmured, ""oh"" and again, ""oh,"""
1021,40,

1043,40,"she withdrew, shrinking from beneath his arm"
1044,40,"that rested on the banister, and slid downstairs;"

1184,43,"   each came singly unto her place,"
1185,43,   but all came every night with the mist;

1188,43,"   one so lonely was fain to list,"
1189,43,   that the stars were almost faded away

1193,43,"   where the flower was before it grew,"

1204,44,   to carry the same to the holy land;

1206,44,   that that was the place to carry a heart
1207,44,"   at loyalty and love's command,"
1208,44,"   and that was the case to carry it in,"
1209,44,   the douglas had not far to win
1210,44,"   before he came to the land of spain,"
1211,44,   where long a holy war had been
1212,44,   against the too-victorious moor;
1213,44,   and there his courage could not endure
1214,44,   not to strike a blow for god
1215,44,"   before he made his errand sure,"
1216,44,"   and ever it was intended so,"
1217,44,"   that a man for god should strike a blow,"
1218,44,   no matter the heart he has in charge
1219,44,"   for the holy land where hearts should go,"
1220,44,"   but when in battle the foe were met,"
1221,44,"   the douglas found him sore beset,"
1222,44,   with only strength of the fighting arm
1223,44,   for one more battle passage yet--
1224,44,   and that as vain to save the day
1225,44,   as bring his body safe away--
1226,44,   only a signal deed to do
1227,44,"   and a last sounding word to say,"
1228,44,   the heart he wore in a golden chain
1229,44,"   he swung and flung forth into the plain,"
1230,44,   and followed it crying 'heart or death!'
1231,44,"   and fighting over it perished fain,"
1232,44,"   so may another do of right,"
1233,44,"   give a heart to the hopeless fight,"
1234,44,   the more of right the more he loves;
1235,44,   so may another redouble might
1236,44,"   for a few swift gleams of the angry brand,"
1237,44,   scorning greatly not to demand
1238,44,   in equal sacrifice with his
1239,44,"   the heart he bore to the holy land,"
1240,45,the same leaves over and over again!
1241,45,they fall from giving shade above
1242,45,to make one texture of faded brown
1243,45,"and fit the earth like a leather glove,"
1244,45,
1245,45,before the leaves can mount again
1246,45,"to fill the trees with another shade,"
1247,45,"they must go down past things coming up,"
1248,45,"they must go down into the dark decayed,"
1249,45,
1250,45,they must be pierced by flowers and put
1251,45,"beneath the feet of dancing flowers,"
1252,45,however it is in some other world
1253,45,"i know that this is way in ours,"
1254,46,"they leave us so to the way we took,"
1255,46,"as two in whom them were proved mistaken,"
1256,46,"that we sit sometimes in the wayside nook,"
1257,46,"with mischievous, vagrant, seraphic look,"
1258,46,"and try if we cannot feel forsaken,"
1259,47,a dented spider like a snow drop white
1260,47,"on a white heal-all, holding up a moth"
1261,47,like a white piece of lifeless satin cloth -
1262,47,saw ever curious eye so strange a sight? -
1263,47,"portent in little, assorted death and blight"
1264,47,like the ingredients of a witches' broth? -
1265,47,"the beady spider, the flower like a froth,"
1266,47,"and the moth carried like a paper kite,"
1267,47,
1268,47,"what had that flower to do with being white,"
1269,47,"the blue prunella every child's delight,"
1270,47,what brought the kindred spider to that height?
1271,47,"make we no thesis of the miller's plight,"
1272,47,what but design of darkness and of night?
1273,47,"design, design! do i use the word aright?"
1274,48,"one of my wishes is that those dark trees,"
1275,48,"so old and firm they scarcely show the breeze,"
1276,48,"were not, as 'twere, the merest mask of gloom,"
1277,48,"but stretched away unto the edge of doom,"
1278,48,
1279,48,i should not be withheld but that some day
1280,48,"into their vastness i should steal away,"
1281,48,"fearless of ever finding open land,"
1282,48,"or highway where the slow wheel pours the sand,"
1283,48,
1284,48,"i do not see why i should e'er turn back,"
1285,48,or those should not set forth upon my track
1286,48,"to overtake me, who should miss me here"
1287,48,"and long to know if still i held them dear,"
1288,48,
1289,48,they would not find me changed from him they knew--
1290,48,"only more sure of all i though was true,"
1291,49,"seek not in me the bit i capital,"
1292,49,"not yet the little dotted in me seek,"
1293,49,"if i have in me any i at all,"
1294,49,"'tis the iota subscript  of the greek,"
1295,49,
1296,49,"so small an i as an attention beggar,"
1297,49,the letter you will find me subscript to
1298,49,"is neither alpha, eta, nor omega,"
1299,49,"but upsilon which is the greek for you, "
1300,50,"a tree's leaves may be ever so good,"
1301,50,"so may its bar, so may its wood;"
1302,50,but unless you put the right thing to its root
1303,50,"it never will show much flower or fruit,"
1304,50,
1305,50,but i may be one who does not care
1306,50,"ever to have tree bloom or bear,"
1307,50,"leaves for smooth and bark for rough,"
1308,50,"leaves and bark may be tree enough,"
1309,50,
1310,50,some giant trees have bloom so small
1311,50,"they might as well have none at all,"
1312,50,"late in life i have come on fern,"
1313,50,"now lichens are due to have their turn,"
1314,50,
1315,50,"i bade men tell me which in brief,"
1316,50,"which is fairer, flower or leaf,"
1317,50,"they did not have the wit to say,"
1318,50,"leaves by night and flowers by day,"
1319,50,
1320,50,"leaves and bar, leaves and bark,"
1321,50,"to lean against and hear in the dark,"
1322,50,"petals i may have once pursued,"
1323,50,"leaves are all my darker mood,"
1324,51,"a stranger came to the door at eve,"
1325,51,"and he spoke the bridegroom fair,"
1326,51,"he bore a green-white stick in his hand,"
1327,51,"and, for all burden, care,"
1328,51,he asked with the eyes more than the lips
1329,51,"for a shelter for the night,"
1330,51,and he turned and looked at the road afar
1331,51,"without a window light,"
1332,51,
1333,51,the bridegroom came forth into the porch
1334,51,"with, 'let us look at the sky,"
1335,51,"and question what of the night to be,"
1336,51,"stranger, you and i,'"
1337,51,"the woodbine leaves littered the yard,"
1338,51,"the woodbine berries were blue,"
1339,51,"autumn, yes, winter was in the wind;"
1340,51,"'stranger, i wish i knew,'"
1341,51,
1342,51,"within, the bride in the dusk alone"
1343,51,"bent over the open fire,"
1344,51,her face rose-red with the glowing coal
1345,51,"and the thought of the heart's desire,"
1346,51,
1347,51,"the bridegroom looked at the weary road,"
1348,51,"yet saw but her within,"
1349,51,and wished her heart in a case of gold
1350,51,"and pinned with a silver pin,"
1351,51,
1352,51,the bridegroom thought it little to give
1353,51,"a dole of bread, a purse,"
1354,51,"a heartfelt prayer for the poor of god,"
1355,51,or for the rich a curse;
1356,51,
1357,51,but whether or not a man was asked
1358,51,to mar the love of two
1359,51,"by harboring woe in the bridal house,"
1360,51,"the bridegroom wished he knew,"
1361,52,as i went down the hill along the wall
1362,52,there was a gate i had leaned at for the view
1363,52,and had just turned from when i first saw you
1364,52,"as you came up the hill, we met, but all"
1365,52,we did that day was mingle great and small
1366,52,footprints in summer dust as if we drew
1367,52,the figure of our being less that two
1368,52,"but more than one as yet, your parasol"
1369,52,"pointed the decimal off with one deep thrust,"
1370,52,and all the time we talked you seemed to see
1371,52,"something down there to smile at in the dust,"
1372,52,"oh, it was without prejudice to me!"
1373,52,afterward i went past what you had passed
1374,52,"before we met and you what i had passed,"
1375,53,"something there is that doesn't love a wall,"
1376,53,"that sends the frozen-ground-swell under it,"
1377,53,and spills the upper boulders in the sun;
1378,53,"and makes gaps even two can pass abreast,"
1379,53,"the work of hunters is another thing,"
1380,53,i have come after them and made repair
1381,53,"where they have left not one stone on a stone,"
1382,53,"but they would have the rabbit out of hiding,"
1383,53,"to please the yelping dogs, the gaps i mean,"
1384,53,"no one has seen them made or heard them made,"
1385,53,"but at spring mending-time we find them there,"
1386,53,i let my neighbor know beyond the hill;
1387,53,and on a day we meet to walk the line
1388,53,"and set the wall between us once again,"
1389,53,"we keep the wall between us as we go,"
1390,53,"to each the boulders that have fallen to each,"
1391,53,and some are loaves and some so nearly balls
1392,53,"we have to use a spell to make them balance,"
1393,53,"""stay where you are until our backs are turned!"""
1394,53,"we wear our fingers rough with handling them,"
1395,53,"oh, just another kind of out-door game,"
1396,53,"one on a side, it comes to little more,"
1397,53,"there where it is we do not need the wall,"
1398,53,"he is all pine and i am apple orchard,"
1399,53,my apple trees will never get across
1400,53,"and eat the cones under his pines, i tell him,"
1401,53,"he only says, ""good fences make good neighbors,"""
1402,53,"spring is the mischief in me, and i wonder"
1403,53,"if i could put a notion in his head,"
1404,53,"""why do they make good neighbors? isn't it"
1405,53,"where there are cows? but here there are no cows,"
1406,53,before i built a wall i'd ask to know
1407,53,"what i was walling in or walling out,"
1408,53,"and to whom i was like to give offence,"
1409,53,"something there is that doesn't love a wall,"
1410,53,"that wants it down,"" i could say ""elves"" to him,"
1411,53,"but it's not elves exactly, and i'd rather"
1412,53,"he said it for himself, i see him there"
1413,53,bringing a stone grasped firmly by the top
1414,53,"in each hand, like an old-stone savage armed,"
1415,53,"he moves in darkness as it seems to me,"
1416,53,"not of woods only and the shade of trees,"
1417,53,"he will not go behind his father's saying,"
1418,53,and he likes having thought of it so well
1419,53,"he says again, ""good fences make good neighbors,"""
1420,54,"there was never a sound beside the wood but one,"
1421,54,"and that was my long scythe whispering to the ground,"
1422,54,what was it it whispered? i knew not well myself;
1423,54,"perhaps it was something about the heat of the sun,"
1424,54,"something, perhaps, about the lack of sound--"
1425,54,"and that was why it whispered and did not speak,"
1426,54,"it was no dream of the gift of idle hours,"
1427,54,"or easy gold at the hand of fay or elf,"
1428,54,anything more than the truth would have seemed too weak
1429,54,"to the earnest love that laid the swale in rows,"
1430,54,not without feeble-pointed spikes of flowers
1431,54,"pale orchises, and scared a bright green snake,"
1432,54,"the fact is the sweetest dream that labour knows,"
1433,54,"my long scythe whispered and left the hay to make,"
1434,55,"thine emulous fond flowers are dead, too,"
1435,55,"and the daft sun-assaulter, he"
1436,55,"that frightened thee so oft, is fled or dead,"
1437,55,save only me
1438,55,nor is it sad to thee!
1439,55,save only me
1440,55,"there is none left to mourn thee in the fields,"
1441,55,
1442,55,the gray grass is scarce dappled with the snow;
1443,55,its two banks have not shut upon the river;
1444,55,but it is long ago--
1445,55,it seems forever--
1446,55,"since first i saw thee glance,"
1447,55,"with all thy dazzling other ones,"
1448,55,"in airy dalliance,"
1449,55,"precipitate in love,"
1450,55,"tossed, tangled, whirled and whirled above,"
1451,55,"like a limp rose-wreath in a fairy dance,"
1452,55,
1453,55,"when that was, the soft mist"
1454,55,"of my regret hung not on all the land,"
1455,55,"and i was glad for thee,"
1456,55,"and glad for me, i wist,"
1457,55,
1458,55,"thou didst not know, who tottered, wandering on high,"
1459,55,"that fate had made thee for the pleasure of the wind,"
1460,55,"with those great careless wings,"
1461,55,"nor yet did i,"
1462,55,
1463,55,"and there were other things,"
1464,55,"it seemed god let thee flutter from his gentle clasp,"
1465,55,then fearful he had let thee win
1466,55,"too far beyond him to be gathered in,"
1467,55,"santched thee, o'ereager, with ungentle gasp,"
1468,55,
1469,55,ah! i remember me
1470,55,how once conspiracy was rife
1471,55,against my life--
1472,55,the languor of it and the dreaming fond;
1473,55,"surging, the grasses dizzied me of thought,"
1474,55,"the breeze three odors brought,"
1475,55,and a gem-flower waved in a wand!
1476,55,
1477,55,then when i was distraught
1478,55,"and could not speak,"
1479,55,"sidelong, full on my cheek,"
1480,55,what should that reckless zephyr fling
1481,55,but the wild touch of thy dye-dusty wing!
1482,55,
1483,55,i found that wing broken today!
1484,55,"for thou art dead, i said,"
1485,55,"and the strange birds say,"
1486,55,i found it with the withered leaves
1487,55,"under the eaves,"
1488,56,"my sorrow, when she's here with me,"
1489,56,thinks these dark days of autumn rain
1490,56,are beautiful as days can be;
1491,56,"she loves the bare, the withered tree;"
1492,56,"she walks the sodden pasture lane,"
1493,56,
1494,56,"her pleasure will not let me stay,"
1495,56,"she talks and i am fain to list,"
1496,56,"she's glad the birds are gone away,"
1497,56,she's glad her simple worsted grey
1498,56,"is silver now with clinging mist,"
1499,56,
1500,56,"the desolate, deserted trees,"
1501,56,"the faded earth, the heavy sky,"
1502,56,"the beauties she so truly sees,"
1503,56,"she thinks i have no eye for these,"
1504,56,"and vexes me for reason why,"
1505,56,
1506,56,not yesterday i learned to know
1507,56,the love of bare november days
1508,56,"before the coming of the snow,"
1509,56,"but it were vain to tell her so,"
1510,56,and they are better for her praise
1511,57,the people along the sand
1512,57,"all turn and look one way,"
1513,57,"they turn their back on the land,"
1514,57,"they look at the sea all day,"
1515,57,
1516,57,as long as it takes to pass
1517,57,a ship keeps raising its hull;
1518,57,the wetter ground like glass
1519,57,reflects a standing gull
1520,57,
1521,57,the land may vary more;
1522,57,but wherever the truth may be--
1523,57,"the water comes ashore,"
1524,57,"and the people look at the sea,"
1525,57,
1526,57,"they cannot look out far,"
1527,57,"they cannot look in deep,"
1528,57,btu when was that ever a bar
1529,57,to any watch they keep?
1530,58,he would declare and could himself believe
1531,58,that the birds there in all the garden round
1532,58,from having heard the daylong voice of eve
1533,58,"had added to their own an oversound,"
1534,58,"her tone of meaning but without the words,"
1535,58,admittedly an eloquence so soft
1536,58,could only have had an influence on birds
1537,58,"when call or laughter carried it aloft,"
1538,58,"be that as may be, she was in their song,"
1539,58,moreover her voice upon their voices crossed
1540,58,had now persisted in the woods so long
1541,58,"that probably it never would be lost,"
1542,58,"never again would birds' song be the same,"
1543,58,"and to do that to birds was why she came,"
1544,59,"they sent him back to her, the letter came"
1545,59,"saying, and she could have him, and before"
1546,59,she could be sure there was no hidden ill
1547,59,"under the formal writing, he was in her sight,"
1548,59,"living, they gave him back to her alive"
1549,59,how else? they are not known to send the dead
1550,59,"and not disfigured visibly, his face?"
1551,59,"his hands? she had to look, and ask,"
1552,59,"""what was it, dear?"" and she had given all"
1553,59,and still she had all they had they the lucky!
1554,59,"wasnâ€™t she glad now? everything seemed won,"
1555,59,"and all the rest for them permissible ease,"
1556,59,"she had to ask, ""what was it, dear?"""
1557,59,
1558,59,"""enough,"""
1559,59,"yet not enough, a bullet through and through,"
1560,59,"high in the breast, nothing but what good care"
1561,59,"and medicine and rest, and you a week,"
1562,59,"can cure me of to go again,"" the same"
1563,59,"grim giving to do over for them both,"
1564,59,she dared no more than ask him with her eyes
1565,59,"how was it with him for a second trial,"
1566,59,"and with his eyes he asked her not to ask,"
1567,59,"they had given him back to her, but not to keep,"
1568,60,"nature's first green is gold,"
1569,60,"her hardest hue to hold,"
1570,60,
1571,60,her early leaf's a flower;
1572,60,"but only so an hour,"
1573,60,
1574,60,"then leaf subsides to leaf,"
1575,60,"so eden sank to grief,"
1576,60,
1577,60,"so dawn goes down to day,"
1578,60,"nothing gold can stay,"
1579,61,"now close the windows and hush all the fields,"
1580,61,"if the trees must, let them silently toss;"
1581,61,"no bird is singing now, and if there is,"
1582,61,"be it my loss,"
1583,61,
1584,61,"it will be long ere the marshes resume,"
1585,61,"i will be long ere the earliest bird,"
1586,61,"so close the windows and not hear the wind,"
1587,61,"but see all wind-stirred,"
